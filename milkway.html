              When we talk about the enormity of the cosmos, it’s easy to toss
              out big numbers – but far more difficult to wrap our minds around
              just how large, how far, and how numerous celestial bodies really
              are.

              To get a better sense, for instance, of the true distances to
              exoplanets – planets around other stars – we might start with the
              theater in which we find them, the Milky Way galaxy

          <p class="text-white">
            Our galaxy is a gravitationally bound collection of stars, swirling
            in a spiral through space. Based on the deepest images obtained so
            far, it’s one of about 2 trillion galaxies in the observable
            universe. Groups of them are bound into clusters of galaxies, and
            these into superclusters; the superclusters are arranged in immense
            sheets stretching across the universe, interspersed with dark voids
            and lending the whole a kind of spiderweb structure.
          </p>
          <p class="text-white">
            Our galaxy probably contains 100 to 400 billion stars, and is about
            100,000 light-years across. That sounds huge, and it is, at least
            until we start comparing it to other galaxies. Our neighboring
            Andromeda galaxy, for example, is some 220,000 light-years wide.
            Another galaxy, IC 1101, spans as much as 4 million light-years.

            It’s one of the most commonly used celestial yardsticks, the
            distance light travels in one year. Light zips along through
            interstellar space at 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) per second
            (more than 66 trips across the entire United States, in one second).
            Multiply that by all the seconds in one year, and you get 5.8
            trillion miles (9.5 trillion kilometers). Just for reference, Earth
            is about eight light minutes from the Sun.

            way, way out there – would take about 1.87 years. Keep going to
            Proxima Centauri, our nearest neighboring star, and plan on arriving
            in 4.25 years at light speed.

          <p class="text-white">
            An exoplanet , is a planet outside of our solar system that usually
            orbits another star in our galaxy. Based on observations made by
            NASA’s Kepler space telescope, we can confidently predict that every
            star you see in the sky probably hosts at least one planet.
            Realistically, we’re most likely talking about multi-planet systems
            rather than just single planets. In our galaxy of hundreds of
            billions of stars, this pushes the number of planets potentially
            into the trillion
          </p>
          <p class="text-white">
            Most of the exoplanets discovered so far are in a relatively small
            region of our galaxy, the Milky Way. ("Small" meaning within
            thousands of light-years of our solar system; one light-year equals
            5.88 trillion miles, or 9.46 trillion kilometers.) That is as far as
            current telescopes have been able to probe. We know from NASA’s
            Kepler Space Telescope that there are more planets than stars in the
            galaxy

            It’s a small, probably rocky planet orbiting Proxima Centauri – as
            mentioned before, the next star over. A little more than four
            light-years away, or 24 trillion miles as the crow flies. If an
            airline offered a flight there by jet, it would take 5 million
            years. Not much is known about this world; its close orbit and the
            periodic flaring of its star lower its chances of being habitable.
          </p>
          <p class="text-white">
            I’d also point you to the TRAPPIST-1 system: seven planets, all
            roughly in Earth’s size range, orbiting a red dwarf star about 40
            light-years away. They are very likely rocky, with four in the
            “habitable zone” – the orbital distance allowing potential liquid
            water on the surface. And computer modeling shows some have a good
            chance of being watery – or icy – worlds. In the next few years, we
            might learn whether they have atmospheres or oceans, or even signs
            of habitability.
